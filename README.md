Project Proposal

Introduction –
The Covid-19 pandemic has given rise to extraordinary challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Understanding the dynamics of ICU bed utilizations, patients hospitalized and the resources’ availability, especially at the state level will help the government to make effective health care decisions.
I will be using the ‘Covid-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State’ data set provided by US Department of Health and Human Services and is owned by the HHS Office of the Chief Data Officer. This data set will be updated once a week so, I will be using the August 28, 2023 version.

By using Data Science techniques, Statistical analysis and Machine Learning algorithms, I will aim to answer some critical questions, including Covid-19 hospitalizations, ICU beds availability and utilization of inpatient beds, related to the impact of Covid-19 on health care systems at state level.

Related Work –
JMIR Public Health Surveillance had produced this analysis of ‘Estimating Covid-19 Hospitalizations in the US with Surveillance Data Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Model’. Estimation for monthly hospitalization rates for Covid-19 from May 2020 to April 2021 across 50 states was done using COVID-NET, and a Bayesian hierarchical model was used for extrapolation. Monthly estimates by state varied significantly. This approach was concluded to have the potential to monitor Covid-19 burden.

Requirements –
Questions that I’ll aim to answer –
•	Are there any geographical clusters of high Covid-19 hospitalizations?
•	Which regions state might need more resources to deal with the pandemic?
•	Any regional differences in ICU bed utilizations?
•	Does age have a say in Covid-19 hospitalizations? How different do paediatrics and adults fare?
•	Any Correlation between beds occupied and deaths recorded?
•	A predictive model to predict the patients getting admitted in the near future, with respect to state.
•	Any correlation between suspected Covid-19 the previous day and the confirmed cases the subsequent day?
Deliverables –
•	Final Report.
•	Project Explanation Video.
Rationales –
The analysis that I make here will significantly help different states deal with the pandemic in an efficient way. The state’s health care systems will be better equipped with the required resources to deal with Covid-19. Also, this analysis may help in predicting the impact of some other virus breakout in the future.
I will be using Python and R to complete this project. I will either use Notebook of Google Colab depending on the density of the problem, and R Studio to do data and statistical analysis.
I believe that I am the right person to do this project because of my innate interest in data analysis and statistics. Also, Covid-19 has played a significant part in latter half of my undergraduate studies, so I am extremely curious to understand its impact from the health care perspective. I have experience applying Machine Learning algorithms using Python and doing statistical analysis using R during my previous semesters at the University of Memphis, and of course I’ll be learning lots of interesting stuff in this course, so I believe I am technically sound enough to get the answers to the questions I proposed. Finally, these points will keep me motivated throughout the semester to complete this project.
